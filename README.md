    > 5) Add a helpful title and description for the reviewer
    > 6) Add a reviewer

    > 2) Go to Repositories
    > 3) Find the repository, and hit Collaborators

    > e. What is the difference between `git` and `GitHub`?
    > `git` is a technology that allows version control, while `Github` is company that has built  
    > software on top of `git` to make version control more user friendly, such as an intuitive
    > website, CLI tool, and detailed docs.

    > f. What does `git diff` do?
    > It allows you to preview changes quickly.

    > g. What is the `main` branch?
    > It is the default or base branch that maintains the most up-to-date code.

    > h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the `main` branch?
    > No, it's a best practice to create a new branch, make changes on that branch, and then open a pull request to merge the branch into `main`.
